    "full_description": "In 1977 Christopher Alexander wrote “A Pattern Language” – a book about architecture and urban planning that proposed a framework of reusable solutions to common design problems. Importantly, this was a toolkit, not a blueprint – allowing for flexibility and creativity to cater to specific needs. This thoughtful approach ensures that the environments created are cohesive and functional, but also allows for them to be beautiful and personal.\nIn a similar sense, we at Mercury are creating a software environment that allows for the most efficient functionality while still being something that people can love and make their own.

UnitedMasters has taken the bold step of building a music distribution service that, radically, puts artists first - disrupting the legacy music business by letting up-and-coming artists distribute their music directly to fans through streaming services while maintaining ownership of their master recording rights and up to 100% of royalties. Through the combination of UnitedMasters’ music distribution platform and its deep ties to brands, UnitedMasters enables independent artists and change-makers to grow and earn unlike any other platform.\nThe UnitedMasters team is made up of musicians, marketers, engineers, and storytellers with backgrounds from YouTube, SoundCloud, Pandora, Facebook, Uber, Dropbox, Complex, VICE, and more. We work hand in hand with the award-winning creative teams that forge those innovative partnerships at Translation (our in-house creative advertising agency).\nWhat's the Role\nUnitedMasters is seeking a Vice President, Artist & Label Marketing to lead marketing strategy and execution across our exclusive artist roster and growing label services business. Some of our exclusive artists include BigXThaPlug, Brent Faiyaz and FloyyMenor. This is a senior leadership role responsible for defining the marketing vision for artists and labels while building and leading a high-performing team.\nThis role blends long-term strategy with day-to-day execution. You will set the roadmap, lead major campaigns and releases, develop talent, and partner closely with artists, managers, and cross-functional teams to drive impact and results. This role sets the creative bar for UnitedMasters’ artist and label marketing by defining what “great” looks like across brand, storytelling, and campaign execution.\nThis is a role for a strategic builder.

By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.\nABOUT THE TEAM\nThis role is part of Anduril’s Corporate Development team and reports to the Head of Corporate Development, with frequent interaction with the c-suite.

As Anduril grows, we will provide additional signal to suppliers about our future needs, allowing them to make good decisions about investing in capacity and designing new products that we will want to use.\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\nYou will develop a repeatable analytical process for assessing Anduril’s long-term industrial capacity needs.

You will liaise with Anduril’s government and media relations functions to share our perspective on building industrial capacity\nYou will guide and mentor peers and team members across the company to strengthen organizational resiliency and ingrain the concept of increasing industrial capacity in advance of demand\nYou will define and incorporate organization-level processes and improvements that enable the business to scale and efficiently utilize its purchasing power, leveraging learnings from world-class manufacturers and other high-volume industries\nYou will develop easy-to-read reporting and dashboards to measure team KPIs and support the program as it scales\nREQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS\n8+ years of work experience with demonstrated successes in a world-leading engineering, manufacturing, technical procurement or supply chain management organization\nAdvanced proficiency in Excel, financial modeling and data analysis tools, and experience with financial reporting tools and ERP systems (i.e. Anaplan, Netsuite, Oracle, Foundry)\nExceptional written and oral communication skills.

    "full_description": "What we’re building\nEvery idea starts with a problem. Ours was simple: Boats are special — but they’re loud, pollutant, unreliable, and stuck in the past. Gas-powered boats dominate not because they’re great, but because no better option has existed. Until now.\nArc is here to change that. We’re building 100% electric boats from the ground up — quicker, quieter, easier to maintain, and better for the water they ride on. We’re not just swapping gas for batteries. We’re rethinking every detail on the boat — from propulsion and powertrain to software and ownership model — applying first-principles engineering from aerospace and EVs to deliver a better boating experience.\nElectric boats haven’t taken over yet.

We deploy self-driving industrial vehicles like forklifts and tuggers to factories, warehouses, and other facilities throughout North America. To build this emergent technology, we are looking for innovative, motivated, and experienced leaders to join us and move this field forward. If you like to build, tinker, and create with a team of trusted and passionate colleagues, then Cyngn is the place for you. Key reasons to join Cyngn:\nWe are small and big.\nWith under 100 employees, Cyngn operates with the energy of a startup. On the other hand, we’re publicly traded. This means our employees not only work in close-knit teams with mentorship from company leaders—they also get access to the liquidity of our publicly-traded equity.\nWe build today and deploy tomorrow.\nOur autonomous vehicles aren’t just test concepts—they’re deployed to real clients right now. That means your work will have a tangible, visible impact.\nWe aren’t robots. We just develop them.\nWe’re a welcoming, diverse team of sharp thinkers and kind humans.

requirements emerge.\nEnsure automations are built to be inheritable and understandable, with documentation aligned to standards for long-term maintainability.\nMonitor performance and troubleshoot issues, proactively implementing improvements that enhance reliability and reduce operational burden.\nCross-functional Partnership & Collaboration:\nPartner with stakeholders across Omada—including P&C, Recruiting, Finance, Care Delivery, Security, Compliance, and Engineering—to understand workflows, challenges, and downstream impacts.\nWork closely with EPD (Engineering, Product, and Design) on automation-related projects, ensuring alignment on technical dependencies, integration points, API behaviors, and system constraints to deliver reliable, scalable solutions.\nProvide technical consultation on automation feasibility, integration complexity, and required process adjustments.\nWork with team members to ensure automations align with standards for change management, data governance, and audit readiness.\nContribute to an automation-as-a-service model by building solutions that leverage reusable logic and consistent design patterns.\nWhat Great Looks Like:\nQuickly understands complex processes, identifies inefficiencies, and executes solutions that deliver measurable value.\nDelivers high-quality automation designs that are resilient, well-documented, and aligned with security and governance standards.\nExercises strong technical judgment, knowing when to keep solutions simple and when robust workflows are required.\nOperates with high autonomy,
