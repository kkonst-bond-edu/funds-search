No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.

    "full_description": "Back to jobs\nNew\nSenior Product Designer - Design Systems\nSan Francisco, CA, New York, NY, Portland, OR, or Remote within Canada or United States\nApply\nIn 1977 Christopher Alexander wrote “A Pattern Language” – a book about architecture and urban planning that proposed a framework of reusable solutions to common design problems. Importantly, this was a toolkit, not a blueprint – allowing for flexibility and creativity to cater to specific needs. This thoughtful approach ensures that the environments created are cohesive and functional, but also allows for them to be beautiful and personal.\nIn a similar sense, we at Mercury are creating a software environment that allows for the most efficient functionality while still being something that people can love and make their own. We’re a financial technology company that helps startups spend less time banking* and more time building. We believe that the key to our success revolves around thoughtful, scalable, and beautifully crafted design.\nWhat We're Looking For\nA product designer to lead and evolve Mercury’s Design System. In this role, you’ll own how our components, patterns and guidelines scale across products - driving consistency, accessibility, and a best-in-class experience for our customers.

You’ll collaborate closely with product designers, engineers and brand partners to create scalable, intuitive and elegant solutions that elevate the Mercury experience and set a high standard of craft across the company.\nOur design team consists of 40+ people who love to solve complex problems through design, but are equally passionate about cultivating, guiding, and inspiring each other.\nKey Responsibilities\nShape and evolve Mercury’s\nDesign System\n, ensuring it is both beautiful and practical.\nTranslate high-craft design into scalable\nsystems and pattern libraries\nthat integrate smoothly into product work.\nWork directly with our engineering and design teams to develop and implement tooling with a focus on maintaining\nspeed & quality.\nRepresent and evangelize the Mercury Design System internally as its\nface and champion\n, building alignment, adoption and support across teams.\nThe ideal candidate for the role has:\nDesign systems expertise\n: comfortable and motivated to work on behind-the-scenes system design as much as product-facing work.\nSystems thinking\n: can balance expressive, high-craft visual design with pragmatic integration into scalable systems.\nStrong and flexible POV\n: confident in their taste and decisions and is collaborative and easy to work with.\nExcellent communication & presence\n: able to represent design systems internally, inspire confidence, and foster adoption.\nThe total rewards package at Mercury includes base salary, equity (stock options), and benefits.\nOur salary and equity ranges are highly competitive within the SaaS and fintech industry and are updated regularly using the most reliable compensation survey data for our industry. New hire offers are made based on a candidate’s experience, expertise, geographic location, and internal pay equity relative to peers.\nOur target new hire base salary ranges for this role are the following:\nUS employees (any location): $189,000–236,200\nCanadian employees (any location): CAD $178,600 – $223,200\n*Mercury is a fintech company,\nnot an FDIC-insured bank\n. Banking services provided through Choice Financial Group and Column N.A., Members FDIC.\nMercury values diversity & belonging and is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer.

Experience with Node.js, Temporal, AWS, or PostgreSQL is a plus. Python experience is welcome if you’re comfortable working primarily in TypeScript.\nProduct-oriented mindset:\nYou think beyond correctness and care about how systems enable intuitive, high-quality customer experiences.\nApplied AI integration experience:\nHands-on experience integrating third-party inference services (such as OpenAI or Anthropic) into real product workflows; model training is not required.\nDistributed systems expertise\n: Comfortable designing event-driven, data-intensive architectures that operate reliably at scale.\nPrompt and context design knowledge\n: Familiarity with prompt construction and context management is a strong plus.\nPragmatic execution style:\nYou balance technical depth with speed, adapt quickly, and enjoy iterating in a fast-moving AI environment.\nBenefits & Perks\nCompetitive Salary\nCompetitive Employee Equity\n401K Program\nMedical, Dental, and Vision Benefits\nFSA/HSA Benefit\n$175/month Commuter Benefit\nAdditional Wellbeing Benefits\nFlexible Paid Time Off\nPaid Parental Leave\nProfessional Development Stipend\nHybrid Office Policy\nLunch and dinner daily\nCompany Sponsored Social Events\nAt Sprig, we pride ourselves on being a people-first company, where your contributions truly matter and are valued.

The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\nCompleting this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at\nwww.dol.gov/ofccp\n.\nHow do you know if you have a disability?\nA disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more of your “major life activities.” If you have or have ever had such a condition, you are a person with a disability.\nDisabilities include, but are not limited to:\nAlcohol or other substance use disorder (not currently using drugs illegally)\nAutoimmune disorder, for example, lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS\nBlind or low vision\nCancer (past or present)\nCardiovascular or heart disease\nCeliac disease\nCerebral palsy\nDeaf or serious difficulty hearing\nDiabetes\nDisfigurement, for example, disfigurement caused by burns, wounds, accidents, or congenital disorders\nEpilepsy or other seizure disorder\nGastrointestinal disorders, for example, Crohn's Disease, irritable bowel syndrome\nIntellectual or developmental disability\nMental health conditions, for example, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD\nMissing limbs or partially missing limbs\nMobility impairment, benefiting from the use of a wheelchair, scooter, walker, leg brace(s) and/or other supports\nNervous system condition, for example, migraine headaches, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS)\nNeurodivergence, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, dyspraxia, other learning disabilities\nPartial or complete paralysis (any cause)\nPulmonary or respiratory conditions, for example, tuberculosis, asthma, emphysema\nShort stature (dwarfism)\nTraumatic brain injury\nDisability Status\nSelect...\nPUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.
