No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.

The Omada IT department builds and operates resilient, scalable services that empower all of Omada.\nJob Overview:\nThe Senior Automation (Systems) Engineer is a senior individual contributor responsible for designing, building, and delivering high-impact automations across Omada’s internal systems ecosystem. This role blends workflow automation, system integration, AI-supported decisioning, and process design to solve complex operational challenges.\nYou will work across the organization—including People & Culture, Recruiting, Finance, Care Delivery, Support, Security, and Engineering—to identify automation opportunities, translate abstract requirements into scalable technical designs, and execute end-to-end delivery.\nIn this role, you are expected to operate with a high degree of autonomy, apply strong technical depth, and consistently produce secure, resilient, and well-designed automations that scale with the business. You will influence the quality of our automation ecosystem through craftsmanship and adherence to standards, without owning team-level frameworks or mentoring responsibilities.\nIntake, Discovery & Solution Analysis:\nParticipate in the intake process by clarifying requirements, gathering context, and translating problem statements into structured technical scopes.\nAssess automation requests against established prioritization criteria—including expected ROI, operational impact, compliance relevance, and alignment with automation standards—to ensure the team focuses on the highest-value opportunities.\nEvaluate technical feasibility, system dependencies, and potential risks of proposed automations to support effective prioritization and planning.\nDeconstruct ambiguous, multi-step processes into clear workflow models that inform design and implementation decisions.\nIdentify risks, edge cases, and downstream impacts early and surface them to the Automation Manager as part of the discovery cycle.\nDesign, Build & Implementation:\nTranslate requirements and PRDs into detailed automation designs across platforms such as Tines, n8n, and API-driven workflows.\nBuild

payloads.\nIterate rapidly on prototypes, validating logic and refining flows to ensure stability, performance, and alignment with business rules.\nEnsure all build artifacts—logic flows, decision models, error handling, and dependency maps—are well-documented and auditable.\nCoordinate with Engineering when custom APIs or technical support is required for automation execution.\nPerform structured UAT with stakeholders, incorporating feedback and ensuring readiness for deployment through change management processes.\nLaunch, Maintenance & Operations:\nOwn the full lifecycle of automation deployments, including testing, launch, hypercare, tuning, and steady-state stabilization.\nMaintain, optimize, and refactor automations as upstream systems evolve or new business requirements emerge.\nEnsure automations are built to be inheritable and understandable, with documentation aligned to standards for long-term maintainability.\nMonitor performance and troubleshoot issues, proactively implementing improvements that enhance reliability and reduce operational burden.\nCross-functional Partnership & Collaboration:\nPartner with stakeholders across Omada—including P&C, Recruiting, Finance, Care Delivery, Security, Compliance, and Engineering—to understand workflows, challenges, and downstream impacts.\nWork closely with EPD (Engineering, Product, and Design) on automation-related projects, ensuring alignment on technical dependencies, integration points, API behaviors, and system constraints to deliver reliable, scalable solutions.\nProvide technical consultation on automation feasibility, integration complexity, and required process adjustments.\nWork with team members to ensure automations align with standards for change management, data governance, and audit readiness.\nContribute to an automation-as-a-service model by building solutions that leverage reusable logic and consistent design patterns.\nWhat Great Looks Like:\nQuickly understands complex processes, identifies inefficiencies, and executes solutions that deliver measurable value.\nDelivers high-quality automation designs that are resilient, well-documented, and aligned with security and governance standards.\nExercises strong technical judgment, knowing when to keep solutions simple and when robust workflows are required.\nOperates with high autonomy, managing full lifecycle delivery of automations with minimal oversight.\nBuilds trust with cross-functional partners through clarity, predictability, and consistent execution.\nIncorporates compliance and auditability into design decisions, aligning with SOX, HIPAA, and security requirements.\nImproves team velocity by producing inheritable workflows and documentation others can easily support.\nConsistently demonstrates senior-level ownership by delivering high-quality solutions independently and driving meaningful cross-functional impact through technical depth and reliable execution.\nCandidate Requirements:\n7+ years of hands-on experience in systems automation, systems engineering, or multi-system workflow integration.\nStrong technical understanding of REST APIs, webhooks, event-driven integrations, and structured JSON.\nProven ability to deconstruct complex business processes into structured workflow models and technical designs.\nHands-on experience building secure, resilient automations in at least one orchestration platform (Tines strongly preferred).\nExperience conducting UAT, validating edge cases, and participating in formal change management processes.\nStrong documentation skills, including workflow diagrams, decision matrices, and technical specifications.\nFamiliarity with AI-assisted decisioning workflows, including LLM prompt design, routing logic, and scenario handling.\nExposure to identity lifecycle automation (Okta, Workday, SCIM provisioning, and attribute-based access approaches such as ABAC).\nDemonstrated Business Process Analysis or process redesign experience applied to cross-functional workflows.\nAbility to write and maintain scripting (Python) for API integrations, data transformations, or workflow logic.\nAbility to operate autonomously in a fast-paced environment while managing multiple concurrent automation projects.\nStrong communication and partnership skills, with the ability to collaborate effectively across technical and non-technical teams.\nNice-to-Haves:\nExperience with additional automation platforms (n8n, Workato, Zapier, or equivalent).\nExperience in SOX, HIPAA, or other audit-aligned environments.\nExposure to monitoring, observability, or logging tooling supporting automation reliability.\nBenefits:\nCompetitive salary with generous annual cash bonus\nEquity Grants\nRemote first

And wait. Sometimes days, weeks, or even months. Why? Because too often specialists and medical services are overwhelmed with referrals and the painstakingly manual process it takes to qualify your referral prevents them from getting around to it on time, or sometimes at all. Tennr prevents these delays and denials by making sure every referral gets where it needs to go, with the right info, at the right time. Powered by RaeLM™ Tennr reads, extracts, and acts on every piece of patient information so providers can capture more referrals, slash denials, and reduce delays.\nRole Description\nWe’re looking for a Controller to own the day-to-day accounting function and build the operating backbone for a scaling company.

This role reports to the CFO and is based in our NYC office.\nThis is a hands-on role. You’ll do the work and improve the work—building processes, cleaning up what’s messy, and making it easier for everyone to move faster with confidence.\nResponsibilities\nOversee the preparation and presentation of accurate and timely financial statements in accordance with GAAP.\nEnsure proper internal controls are in place to safeguard company assets, monitor financial performance, and ensure regulatory compliance.\nLead the monthly, quarterly, and annual financial close process, including account reconciliations, journal entries, tax reporting, and variance analyses.\nDevelop and maintain a robust system of internal controls to safeguard company assets and ensure data integrity.\nCoordinate and oversee annual audit, including preparation and coordination of audit schedules and support requested by external auditors.\nProvide financial data and analysis to support ad hoc projects related to strategic decision-making, budgeting, and long-term financial planning.\nManage the current outsourced accounting function with the near-term goal of building a top tier Accounting function in house.\nQualifications\nRequired\n5+ years of progressive accounting experience, with at least 2 years in a Controller or Assistant Controller role, preferably at a high-growth technology company.\nCPA (or equivalent) and deep technical knowledge of US GAAP.\nProven experience in managing a full-cycle accounting process, including financial close and external audit.\nProficiency in financial reporting software (e.g., NetSuite, QuickBooks) and advanced Excel modeling skills.\nStrong written and verbal communication skills, with the ability to clearly articulate complex financial issues to non-financial stakeholders.\nPreferred\nExperience working with venture-backed companies and understanding of SaaS or recurring revenue accounting models.\nFamiliarity with financial regulations in the US healthcare industry.\nBackground in process automation and implementing new financial systems.\nExperience working in a remote or hybrid environment.\nWhy Tennr?\nDrive Impact: one of our company values is Cowboy, meaning you set the pace. You won’t just talk about things, you’ll get them done. And feel the impact.\nDevelop Operational Expertise: learn the inner workings of scaling systems, tools, and infrastructure\nInnovate with Purpose: we’re not just doing this for fun (although we do have a lot of fun). At Tennr, you’ll join a high-caliber team maniacally focused on reducing patient delays across the U.S. healthcare system.\nBuild Relationships: collaborate and connect with like-minded, driven individuals in our Chelsea office 4 days/week (preferred)\nFree lunch!

We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world.

We also understand that in order to realize this value, we must be intentional.\nTo get a comprehensive understanding of our pipeline, we invite all applicants to fill out these demographic questions. Completion of this form is entirely voluntary and declining to provide this information will not subject you to adverse treatment.\nAll responses to this survey will be kept anonymous.\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.

Classification of protected categories\n  is as follows:\nA \"disabled veteran\" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.\nA \"recently separated veteran\" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.\nAn \"active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran\" means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.\nAn \"Armed forces service medal veteran\" means a veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985.\nVeteran Status\nSelect...\nVoluntary Self-Identification of Disability\nForm CC-305\nPage 1 of 1\nOMB Control Number 1250-0005\nExpires 04/30/2026\nWhy are you being asked to complete this form?\nWe are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\nCompleting this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at\nwww.dol.gov/ofccp\n.\nHow do you know if you have a disability?\nA disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more of your “major life activities.” If you have or have ever had such a condition, you are a person with a disability.\nDisabilities include, but are not limited to:\nAlcohol or other substance use disorder (not currently using drugs illegally)\nAutoimmune disorder, for example, lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS\nBlind or low vision\nCancer (past or present)\nCardiovascular or heart disease\nCeliac disease\nCerebral palsy\nDeaf or serious difficulty hearing\nDiabetes\nDisfigurement, for example, disfigurement caused by burns, wounds, accidents, or congenital disorders\nEpilepsy or other seizure disorder\nGastrointestinal disorders, for example, Crohn's Disease, irritable bowel syndrome\nIntellectual or developmental disability\nMental health conditions, for example, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD\nMissing limbs or partially missing limbs\nMobility impairment, benefiting from the use of a wheelchair, scooter, walker, leg brace(s) and/or other supports\nNervous system condition, for example, migraine headaches, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS)\nNeurodivergence, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, dyspraxia, other learning disabilities\nPartial or complete paralysis (any cause)\nPulmonary or respiratory conditions, for example, tuberculosis, asthma, emphysema\nShort stature (dwarfism)\nTraumatic brain injury\nDisability Status\nSelect...\nPUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.

Our core product suite includes high-throughput market data pipelines, automated smart order routing algorithms, real-time portfolio ledgering and position tracking, and high-cardinality portfolio optimization.\nFounded in 2023 by a team of quant traders and researchers from Citadel and Jane Street, we've raised over $100M in capital from Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Lightspeed Venture Partners and now power mission critical workflows for financial institutions with over $8T+ of assets.\nMission\nAt Moment, the Platform team’s job is to pave the road for success. We exist to help engineers move quicker, safer, and with deeper visibility. We treat our internal platform as a product, with our engineers as the customers.\nThe Role\nWe are looking for an engineer who is skilled and experienced in Cloud infrastructure. You will report to the Platform team, serving as our infrastructure specialist. You will balance architectural design in AWS with the ability to\nship actual code solutions,\nnot just configuration files or Terraform. You will bridge the gap between Terraform modules and backend logic, ensuring our systems are resilient, automated, and capable of surviving regional failures.\nWhat you'll do...\nLead the Disaster Recovery initiative\nWe are targeting a major milestone this year: setting up comprehensive Disaster Recovery. You will design and execute our multi-region strategy from the ground up. You will help design and execute this strategy, with help from the team, to hit our RTO and RPO targets.\nShip code\nYou are capable of writing backend code to solve infrastructure problems, whether that’s coding a custom CLI tool in Go to streamline deployments or scripting complex automation logic that Terraform can’t handle.\nArchitect \"Golden Paths\"\nYou will build and maintain the core Terraform modules and CI/CD pipelines that power our engineering organization. You will create reusable, v\ne\nrsioned infrastructure components that allow product teams to provision resources (ECS, RDS, S3, MSK) safely and autonomously.\nOwn Reliability and On-Call\nYou will be a key player in our on-call rotation. You will set the standard for how we observe and debug our cloud footprint. This involves configuring comprehensive alerting, optimizing costs, and ensuring that our multi-region setup is actually observable.\nIdeal Candidate Profile\nYou are compassionate and empathetic to your customers: the developers at Moment. You hear them out, take feedback seriously, and ship solutions which help them.\nYou have\n2+ years of AWS and Terraform experience\n, but you are also a capable coder. You can read and contribute to application code when debugging infrastructure issues. (\nGo experience is a major plus\n, but fluency in Python/Rust/Java is acceptable if you are willing to learn).\nYou have worked in a multi-region environment and understand the physics of distributed systems. You are ready to apply that knowledge to build a greenfield DR strategy.\nYou treat infrastructure as a product.

You will roll out a thoughtful data governance framework, managing role-based access requests to balance stakeholder needs with the responsibility to safeguard confidential employee data.\nDrive operational scalability: You will continually assess our workflows to identify bottlenecks. Whether it’s automating a manual task or redesigning a rollout, you’ll identify areas of opportunity to scale our impact and deliver high-touch support that Everlawyers can count on.\nUphold data as a source of truth: You will serve as the primary guardian of our people data, ensuring it is accurate, accessible, and used to drive informed decision-making across the People team.\nAbout you\nYou are a...\nStrategic Systems Thinker.

    "full_description": "Job Application for Technical Business Operations, Air Dominance & Strike  at Anduril Industries\nNew\nTechnical Business Operations, Air Dominance & Strike\nCosta Mesa, California, United States\nAnduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.\nABOUT THE TEAM\nThe goal of Anduril’s Air Dominance and Strike Division is to fundamentally reshape the way future peer to peer conflicts are fought by developing next generation Collaborative Combat Aircraft (\nFury\n), missiles such as\nRoadRunner\nand\nBarracuda\n, and the\nMission Autonomy\nsoftware that powers these autonomous weapons.\nThe AD&S Operations team is a small but mighty team of business generalists who enable the division to scale through hyper-growth while breaking as few things as possible.\nABOUT THE JOB\nTechnical Business Operations Associates\nwork on some of the most ambiguous, high-leverage problems at Anduril — combining operational rigor, technical curiosity, and strategic thinking to build solutions that scale. Across field ops, engineering, supply chain, and product, your job is to make Anduril run more efficiently by solving the messy, cross-functional problems that don’t fall neatly into a single team’s lane. Past projects have focused on accelerating hardware development cycles, scaling our sustainment operations, and enabling customer-facing analytical workflows.\nThis is not a traditional BizOps role. It’s a\nbuilder-operator role\nfor those who thrive in ambiguity, move fast, and care deeply about outcomes. You might have been an engineer, PM, consultant, or founder — and here, you’ll apply those instincts to the problems that power Anduril’s growth.\nWhat you’ll do\nOwn and deliver cross-functional initiatives\nfrom zero to one, from framing the problem to executing on a chosen solution.\nOperate across both hardware and software\n, bringing solutions to problems across Flight Test, Supply Chain, Engineering, Manufacturing, Deployment Operations, Finance, HR, Recruiting, and more.\nWork deeply within\nAnduril’s business systems\n(including our ERP, MRP, and MES) to develop a clear understanding of how data and processes flow across the company.\nDevelop analytics and tooling\nthat shape decision-making, ranging from scrappy, ad hoc Excel data crunching to scalable data pipelines and products.\nProject manage across teams\n, leading meetings of large and small groups and managing digital communication channels to direct stakeholders towards solutions.\nPartner with senior leaders\nto bring structure, insight, and velocity to Anduril’s highest-priority operational challenges.\nRequired Qualifications\n2+ years of experience in consulting, business operations, strategy, or engineering/technical roles.\nMust be eligible to obtain and maintain a U.S. TS clearance.\nYou’re technical—you are data-driven, understand systems, and know how to communicate with engineering and product teams.\nYou’re strategic—you zoom out to define frameworks, build business cases, and integrate solutions into broader company initiatives.\nYou’re a builder—you’d rather design and implement a better solution than patch around a broken one.\nYou’re self-driven and proactive—your bias is for action rather than delay.\nYou’re comfortable in ambiguity—you get energy from untangling complex, messy problems.\nYou’re clear—you communicate effectively, including in both technical and non-technical contexts.\nNice to haves\nExperience with technical systems in hardware + software environments (e.g., logistics tech, manufacturing systems, or ERP implementations).\nExposure to classified or regulated workflows.\nBackground working in cross-functional, fast-paced environments without a playbook.\nUS Salary Range\n$146,000\n-\n$194,000\nUSD\nThe salary range for this role is an estimate based on a wide range of compensation factors, inclusive of base salary only. Actual salary offer may vary based on (but not limited to) work experience, education and/or training, critical skills, and/or business considerations. Highly competitive equity grants are included in the majority of full time offers; and are considered part of Anduril's total compensation package. Additionally, Anduril offers top-tier benefits for full-time employees, including:\nHealthcare Benefits\nUS Roles:\nComprehensive medical, dental, and vision plans at little to no cost to you.\nUK & AUS Roles:\nWe cover full cost of medical insurance premiums for you and your dependents.\nIE Roles:\nWe offer an annual contribution toward your private health insurance for you and your dependents.\nAdditional Benefits\nIncome Protection\n: Anduril covers life and disability insurance for all employees.\nGenerous time off\n: Highly competitive PTO plans with\na holiday hiatus in December.

No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.

We exist to help engineers move quicker, safer, and with deeper visibility. We treat our internal platform as a product, with our engineers as the customers.\nThe Role\nWe are looking for an engineer who can balance high-level architectural design in AWS with low-level backend coding in Go.

You will design capable architectures on a whiteboard and are comfortable getting your hands dirty debugging production performance, tuning database parameters, and automating toil.\nTreat the platform as the product\nYou will embed with product teams to understand their friction points, treating them as your customers. You will champion a philosophy where we build tools that are intuitive and helpful.\nElevate observability\nYou will set the standard for how we observe and debug our systems. This involves going deep into the stack to debug distributed system failures, improving our alerting strategy to reduce noise, and teaching the wider engineering team how to troubleshoot effectively.\nBe a mentor and technical leader\nYou will also drive technical standards across the company by documenting patterns, writing clear guides, presenting to all engineers, and mentoring engineers on best practices.\nIdeal Candidate Profile\nDeep expertise in backend programming\nYou have significant experience building high-performance backend services or libraries. You understand the nuances of the language and how to write code that others find easy to read and import.\nCloud fluency\nYou have architected and managed production workloads on AWS or other clouds.

The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\nCompleting this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.

    "full_description": "Job Application for Software Engineer, Simulation at Anduril Industries\nNew\nSoftware Engineer, Simulation\nCosta Mesa, California, United States\nAnduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.\nThe Air Defense team builds robots that find other robots and knock them out of the sky. At a time when air superiority can no longer be taken for granted, the Air Defense Team provides mission critical capabilities to warfighters. From detection to tracking, identification, deterrence, and defeat, our family of networked sensors and effectors enables our customers to rapidly close the kill chain against a broad range of Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) threats. Working across product, engineering, sales, logistics, operations, and mission success, the Air Defense team develops, tests, deploys, and sustains the Anduril Air Defense Family of Systems (FoS) in challenging operational environments worldwide.\nABOUT THE JOB\nAs a Software Engineer, you will solve a wide variety of problems involving networking, autonomy, systems integration, robotics, and most notably sim, while making pragmatic engineering tradeoffs along the way. Your efforts will ensure that Anduril products seamlessly work together to achieve a variety of critical outcomes. Above all, Mission Software Engineers are driven by a “Whatever It Takes” mindset—executing in an\nexpedient\n,\nscalable\n, and\npragmatic\nway while keeping the mission top-of-mind and making sound engineering decisions to deliver successful outcomes correctly, on-time, and with high quality.\nTo date, capability groups within Air Defense have been largely left to their own devices when it comes to simulation capabilities. This means existing solutions have been team-specific, non-standard, and do not capture the full impact across our Family of Systems. Further, these systems do not have a common architecture or path to converge and provide insights to higher-level mission impacts across groups of assets. This convergence is also required for many initiatives - for example, to achieve representative analysis of system-level performance within Classified computing environments, a major ask from multiple partner entities. Now, we are in search of a Software Engineer that can help lay out and execute a vision for shared simulation and SITL development roadmap across the capability groups within our broad Family of Systems.\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\nOwn the software solutions that are deployed to customers.\nWrite code to improve products and scale the mission capability to more customers.\nCollaborate across multiple teams to plan, build, and test complex functionality.\nCreate and analyze metrics that are leveraged for debugging and monitoring.\nTriage issues, root cause failures, and coordinate next-steps.\nPartner with end-users to turn needs into features while balancing user experience with engineering constraints.\nTravel up to 30% of time to build, test, and deploy capabilities in the real world.\nCORE REQUIREMENTS\nStrong engineering background from industry or school, ideally in areas/fields such as Computer Science, Software Engineering, Mathematics, or Physics.\n4+ years working with a variety of programming languages such as C++, Rust, Go, Typescript, etc.\nExperience building software solutions involving significant amounts of data processing and analysis.\nAbility to quickly understand and navigate complex systems and established code bases.\nA desire to work on critical software that has a real-world impact.\nDESIRED REQUIREMENTS\nStrong background with focus in Physics, Mathematics, and/or Motion Planning to inform modeling & simulation (M&S) and physical systems.\nDeveloping and testing multi-agent autonomous systems and deploying in real-world environments.\nFeature and algorithm development with an understanding of behavior trees.\nDeveloping software/hardware for flight systems and safety critical functionality.\nDistributed communication networks and message standards. Knowledge of military systems and operational tactics.\nEligibility to obtain and maintain a U.S. TS clearance.\nUS Salary Range\n$166,000\n-\n$220,000\nUSD\nThe salary range for this role is an estimate based on a wide range of compensation factors, inclusive of base salary only.

Everyone needs a place to live and access to quality healthcare, yet both are often harder to secure than they should be.\nBy integrating AI agents deeply into existing workflows, we make them more efficient, reduce costs, and improve the experience for everyone.\nHousing\n: We simplify how renters tour apartments, sign leases, submit maintenance requests, and stay connected with their property team—bringing everything they need for their home into one place.\nHealthcare\n: We make it easy to schedule appointments, complete intake forms, and we help patients communicate with providers, so everyone can focus on health instead of paperwork.\nWith EliseAI, organizations reduce manual work, improve accessibility, and deliver a seamless experience across essential services.

Here, you own your impact; full autonomy, no micromanagement, no fluff. We hire the best, expect the best, and give you the masterclass of your career.

Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.\nBenefits\nIn addition to the growth and impact you’ll have at EliseAI, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:\nEquity in the company\nMedical, Dental and Vision premiums covered at 100%\nFully paid parental leave\nCommuter benefits\n401k benefits\nFitness & home services stipend to cover part of your expenses so you can focus on what matters\nA collaborative in-office environment with an open floor plan, fully stocked kitchen, and all meals covered in the office\nUnlimited vacation and paid holidays\nWe'll cover relocation packages and make the move exciting, not painful!\nJob Compensation Range\nThe salary range for this role is $120,000 - $185,000.

In this role, you will own multiple Product teams’ ML Systems, covering Efficiency and Reliability, for our core machine learning pipelines.\nYou will act as a \"force multiplier.\" While our ML researchers focus on novel model architectures and signal quality, you will focus on the ecosystem that enables them: optimizing training loops on our distributed cluster management system, streamlining data ingestion, and eliminating friction in the build and version control workflows. You will also write the high-performance \"glue\" that binds our model logic to our massive-scale proprietary infrastructure.\nYou will:\nStrategic Infra Roadmap:\nPartner with Core Infrastructure teams to influence the roadmap for compute, storage, and scheduling.

Most don't want to be landlords anymore, but selling isn’t a good option. Why? You’d lose income and appreciation, trigger tax liabilities, kick out your tenants, have to fix up the house – the list goes on! Flock is here to help.\nFlock’s mission is to provide every retiring landlord with the most cost-efficient and seamless exit. Our first product is a tech-enabled 721 Exchange for Single Family Rental landlords. Owners contribute properties into our professionally managed Fund, in exchange for passive equity ownership. It's a modern UPREIT model designed for sophisticated owners who want access to continued cashflows, liquidity, and diversification without triggering capital gains, disturbing tenants, or dealing with disposition friction. We’re now growing fast into the commercial and multifamily space and are looking for smart, entrepreneurial hustlers who want to help build something category-defining.\nWe recently raised our Series B, led by Renegade Partners, and are also backed by other top tier investors, including Andreessen Horowitz, Primary Ventures, SUSA Ventures, 1Sharpe Ventures, and leaders from Invitation Homes and Opendoor.\nAbout the Role\nFlock is hiring a\nCapital Markets Analyst\nto join our team.

You will produce high-quality offering memorandums and investor presentations that clearly articulate the \"why\" behind an investment decision.\nExecute Due Diligence:\nSupport the transaction process by obtaining documents from owners, lenders, legal counsel, and third-parties, ensuring seamless transaction execution.\nOptimize Portfolio Performance:\nTrack and report on asset performance, identifying opportunities for refinancing or disposition based on shifting market conditions.\nAbout You\n1–3 years of professional experience\nin investment banking, private equity, or commercial real estate finance.\nExpert-level Excel skills:\nYou should be comfortable building models from scratch, utilizing advanced formulas, and ensuring \"audit-ready\" accuracy.\nReal Estate Fluency:\nA basic understanding of real estate, property values, and related investment concepts (loans, joint ventures, etc.).\nNarrative Power:\nThe ability to write clearly and design professional collateral that tells a compelling investment story.\nOwnership:\nDesire to grow your impact, balancing speed of delivery with judicious prioritization.\nGrit:\nA proactive mindset and the ability to manage multiple tight deadlines without sacrificing attention to detail.\nProblem Solver:\nAbility to think on your feet, handle objections, and find creative solutions.\nEthical:\nConduct business with the highest level of integrity and professionalism.\nEven if you don’t meet 100% of the qualifications, we recommend applying to the role!\nThe target annual salary for this role $90-115k, plus equity and benefits (medical/dental/vision insurance, 401k, and unlimited PTO).\nCreate a Job Alert\nInterested in building your career at Flock Homes?

No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.

Importantly, this was a toolkit, not a blueprint – allowing for flexibility and creativity to cater to specific needs. This thoughtful approach ensures that the environments created are cohesive and functional, but also allows for them to be beautiful and personal.\nIn a similar sense, we at Mercury are creating a software environment that allows for the most efficient functionality while still being something that people can love and make their own. We’re a financial technology company that helps startups spend less time banking* and more time building. We believe that the key to our success revolves around thoughtful, scalable, and beautifully crafted design.\nWhat We're Looking For\nA product designer to lead and evolve Mercury’s Design System. In this role, you’ll own how our components, patterns and guidelines scale across products - driving consistency, accessibility, and a best-in-class experience for our customers.

You’ll collaborate closely with product designers, engineers and brand partners to create scalable, intuitive and elegant solutions that elevate the Mercury experience and set a high standard of craft across the company.\nOur design team consists of 40+ people who love to solve complex problems through design, but are equally passionate about cultivating, guiding, and inspiring each other.\nKey Responsibilities\nShape and evolve Mercury’s\nDesign System\n, ensuring it is both beautiful and practical.\nTranslate high-craft design into scalable\nsystems and pattern libraries\nthat integrate smoothly into product work.\nWork directly with our engineering and design teams to develop and implement tooling with a focus on maintaining\nspeed & quality.\nRepresent and evangelize the Mercury Design System internally as its\nface and champion\n, building alignment, adoption and support across teams.\nThe ideal candidate for the role has:\nDesign systems expertise\n: comfortable and motivated to work on behind-the-scenes system design as much as product-facing work.\nSystems thinking\n: can balance expressive, high-craft visual design with pragmatic integration into scalable systems.\nStrong and flexible POV\n: confident in their taste and decisions and is collaborative and easy to work with.\nExcellent communication & presence\n: able to represent design systems internally, inspire confidence, and foster adoption.\nThe total rewards package at Mercury includes base salary, equity (stock options), and benefits.\nOur salary and equity ranges are highly competitive within the SaaS and fintech industry and are updated regularly using the most reliable compensation survey data for our industry. New hire offers are made based on a candidate’s experience, expertise, geographic location, and internal pay equity relative to peers.\nOur target new hire base salary ranges for this role are the following:\nUS employees (any location): $189,000–236,200\nCanadian employees (any location): CAD $178,600 – $223,200\n*Mercury is a fintech company,\nnot an FDIC-insured bank\n.

Whatever your decision, it will not be considered in the hiring\nprocess or thereafter. Any information that you do provide will be recorded and maintained in a\nconfidential file.\nAs set forth in Instabase’s Equal Employment Opportunity policy,\nwe do not discriminate on the basis of any protected group status under any applicable law.\nGender\nSelect...\nAre you Hispanic/Latino?\nSelect...\nRace & Ethnicity Definitions\nIf you believe you belong to any of the categories of protected veterans listed below, please indicate by making the appropriate selection.\n  As a government contractor subject to the Vietnam Era Veterans Readjustment Assistance Act (VEVRAA), we request this information in order to measure\n  the effectiveness of the outreach and positive recruitment efforts we undertake pursuant to VEVRAA. Classification of protected categories\n  is as follows:\nA \"disabled veteran\" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.\nA \"recently separated veteran\" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.\nAn \"active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran\" means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.\nAn \"Armed forces service medal veteran\" means a veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985.\nVeteran Status\nSelect...\nVoluntary Self-Identification of Disability\nForm CC-305\nPage 1 of 1\nOMB Control Number 1250-0005\nExpires 04/30/2026\nWhy are you being asked to complete this form?\nWe are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\nCompleting this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at\nwww.dol.gov/ofccp\n.\nHow do you know if you have a disability?\nA disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more of your “major life activities.” If you have or have ever had such a condition, you are a person with a disability.\nDisabilities include, but are not limited to:\nAlcohol or other substance use disorder (not currently using drugs illegally)\nAutoimmune disorder, for example, lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS\nBlind or low vision\nCancer (past or present)\nCardiovascular or heart disease\nCeliac disease\nCerebral palsy\nDeaf or serious difficulty hearing\nDiabetes\nDisfigurement, for example, disfigurement caused by burns, wounds, accidents, or congenital disorders\nEpilepsy or other seizure disorder\nGastrointestinal disorders, for example, Crohn's Disease, irritable bowel syndrome\nIntellectual or developmental disability\nMental health conditions, for example, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD\nMissing limbs or partially missing limbs\nMobility impairment, benefiting from the use of a wheelchair, scooter, walker, leg brace(s) and/or other supports\nNervous system condition, for example, migraine headaches, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS)\nNeurodivergence, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, dyspraxia, other learning disabilities\nPartial or complete paralysis (any cause)\nPulmonary or respiratory conditions, for example, tuberculosis, asthma, emphysema\nShort stature (dwarfism)\nTraumatic brain injury\nDisability Status\nSelect...\nPUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number. This survey should take about 5 minutes to complete.\nPowered by\nGreenhouse"

Classification of protected categories\n  is as follows:\nA \"disabled veteran\" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.\nA \"recently separated veteran\" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.\nAn \"active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran\" means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.\nAn \"Armed forces service medal veteran\" means a veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985.\nVeteran Status\nSelect...\nVoluntary Self-Identification of Disability\nForm CC-305\nPage 1 of 1\nOMB Control Number 1250-0005\nExpires 04/30/2026\nWhy are you being asked to complete this form?\nWe are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\nCompleting this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.

By mastering the complexities of CMS provider submissions and ACO operations, you will directly safeguard the integrity of our networks and enable compliant operations and access to enhanced benefits for our members. This is an invitation to build operational resilience from the ground up, transitioning a vital function from a \"heroic effort\" to a sustainable, best-in-class program that scales with our growth.\nWho We Are\nPearl Health is dedicated to empowering primary care providers, health systems, and physician-led networks to succeed in the shift to value-based care. Our platform delivers the technology, financial tools, and expert services that enable practices to provide more proactive, effective care to their Medicare patients, ultimately lowering costs and improving health outcomes.\nFounded in 2020, we are a team of healthcare and technology innovators backed by premier investors like Andreessen Horowitz, Viking Global Investors, and AlleyCorp. We partner with thousands of providers across 44 states to build a more sustainable future for American healthcare.\nWhat You'll Do\nAs the Director of ACO Operations, you will be the primary architect and executor of our CMS Program Operations, ensuring every roster submission and regulatory requirement is met with precision. You will bridge the gap between tactical execution and strategic program ownership to ensure our ACOs remain compliant.\nLead the end-to-end Provider Submission process, serving as the accountable leader for roster accuracy and CMS deadlines during critical windows.\nManage the Roster Management System (RMS) workflow, overseeing the transition of provider data into a streamlined, automated submission process.\nProvide strategic oversight and execution of Beneficiary Enhancement (BE) and Beneficiary Engagement Incentive (BEI) programs, ensuring all BE/BEI filings are accurate and compliant with CMS standards.\nDirect the development of educational materials and training programs for internal Pearl employees to socialize complex ACO regulatory requirements.\nOversee mandatory CMS operational tasks, including CEHRT compliance, MSSP applications, and the coordination of beneficiary notification letters.\nResponsible for CMS-related knowledge management and partnership with the Program Owner and SMEs to modernize our program operations, documenting processes to eliminate \"sausage-making\" during peak cycles.\nManage external resources and contractors during high-volume periods to maintain high quality-control standards under tight regulatory pressure.\nWhat You’ll Bring\nWe are looking for a seasoned operations leader who thrives in the \"details of the data\" and possesses the regulatory fluency to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of CMS programs.\nMust-haves\nOrchestrate complex, multi-phase project lifecycles, ensuring seamless delivery within high-pressure environments and rigid deadlines.\nMaintain a zero-margin-for-error standard while overseeing the ingestion and processing of high-volume, mission-critical data sets.\nProactively identify and resolve bottlenecks in data-intensive workflows to prevent downstream inaccuracies.\nDeep technical knowledge of value-based care programs (eg. ACO REACH and/or MSSP) and regulations, with the ability to translate complex CMS guidelines into actionable project plans.\nAccountability for regulatory deadlines, with a proven track record of meeting multi-stakeholder filing requirements without constant oversight.\nNice-to-haves\nDirect experience with CMS provider submissions, having successfully managed at least one full roster cycle for an ACO or similar value-based care entity.\nExperience implementing or managing a Roster Management System (RMS) or similar tool used to automate provider data flows.\nBackground in CMS program management or policy, particularly experience with BEI programs and compliance frameworks.\nPrior leadership in a high-growth startup environment, where you have successfully transitioned tactical \"sprint\" work into repeatable programmatic systems.\nThis role might not be for you if:\nYou prefer a role focused exclusively on high-level strategy; this position requires a \"player-coach\" who will be deep in tactical execution, especially during the first year.\nYou thrive in highly predictable, steady-state environments; the submission cycle involves intense \"sprint\" periods with significant volume and shifting CMS priorities.\nYou prefer working in a siloed department; this role requires constant, proactive collaboration with Product, Client Success, and Quality teams to be successful.\nOur Values\n🤝\nCollaborate to Innovate:\nWe believe the best solutions arise from intelligent teamwork. We trust the expertise of our teammates and pursue opportunities to learn and grow from each other. By embracing diverse perspectives and encouraging authenticity, we create and evangelize groundbreaking health solutions.\n🗣️\nTrust Through Transparency:\nWe prioritize transparency in all our interactions, ensuring that employees, patients, clinicians, and partners have access to the information they need to make informed decisions. Integrity is at the core of how we operate.\n❤️\nSerious Impact, Big Heart:\nWe go above and beyond to empower proactive, patient-centered care — and we celebrate every step forward. Humor and positivity fuel our creativity and strengthen relationships.\nWe are an Equal Opportunity Employer on a mission to improve lives. Our strength comes from the diverse backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives of our team. We welcome all candidates and are committed to a fair, inclusive hiring process free from discrimination.\nWhat We Offer\nThe expected offer for this role includes the following components:\nBase Salary Range:\n$150,000 - $195,000 per year\nAdditional Compensation:\nEligible for a discretionary performance bonus and equity options\nBenefits:\nWe offer a competitive benefits package.

If a resume is submitted to any Pearl Health employee by a third party without a valid written and signed search agreement, it will become the property of Pearl Health and no fee will be paid, irrespective of whether the candidate is hired.\nThe Interview Process\nWhile steps may vary by role, you can typically expect:\nRecruiter Screen:\nIntroductory call to discuss background and motivation\nSubject Matter Expert Interview:\nDeep-dive conversation with a core member of the team\nPanel Interview:\nMeetings with teammates and cross-functional partners\nCase Assignment / Presentation:\nPractical exercise solving a real-world challenge\nExecutive Interview:\nFinal conversation(s) with 1–2 members of our leadership team\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nPowered by\nAshby\nPrivacy Policy\nSecurity\nVulnerability Disclosure"

We believe the future of experience research won’t be powered by slow, siloed platforms. It will be fast, intelligent, and deeply integrated into how modern teams build great products.\nOur mission is to make deep customer understanding effortless and always on. With Sprig, product teams no longer guess. They know. We are creating a future where AI uncovers insights, accelerates workflows, and enables teams to deliver exceptional customer experiences in real-time.\nCompanies like Notion, Figma, Coinbase, and TripAdvisor already use Sprig to stay closer to their customers than ever before. We’re scaling quickly toward $100M ARR, launching new AI-powered capabilities, and expanding our impact across the world’s most innovative companies.\nIf you're energized by bold ideas, rapid growth, and the opportunity to redefine an entire category, we'd love to meet you.\nAbout the Role\nSprig’s AI engineering group builds the core technology that enables UX researchers and product leaders to understand customer behavior and feedback at massive scale. Our platform ingests and processes hundreds of millions of events daily and powers large volumes of AI-driven analysis to turn raw signals into clear, actionable insights for product teams.\nIn this role, you’ll be responsible for the backend systems that support this work—high-throughput data pipelines, AI inference orchestration, and the integrations that connect applied AI directly into Sprig’s product experience. You’ll help evolve the technical foundation that allows our customers to trust, scale, and operationalize AI-powered understanding.\nWhile the team collaborates across the full stack, this position is primarily focused on backend and distributed systems, with close proximity to applied AI infrastructure. You’ll work alongside engineers who value thoughtful design, practical solutions, and shipping work that makes a measurable difference for customers—while maintaining strong standards around reliability, privacy, and correctness.\nThis is a hybrid position requiring three days per week in our downtown San Francisco office, conveniently located near Montgomery BART.\nYour Impact\nBuild and operate core backend systems:\nDesign, implement, and deploy distributed services and workflows that underpin Sprig’s AI-powered insights, owning projects from early design through production rollout.\nSupport product-facing experiences:\nWhile backend-focused, contribute across the stack as needed to enable the product features that surface AI analysis to researchers and PMs.\nAdvance data and inference workflows\n: Develop and maintain scalable pipelines for large-scale data processing and AI inference, ensuring performance, reliability, and operational clarity.\nInfluence technical decisions:\nParticipate in system design and planning discussions, helping balance iteration speed with long-term system health and scalability.\nPartner cross-functionally:\nCollaborate closely with product managers, designers, and other engineering teams to shape requirements and deliver well-scoped, high-impact capabilities.\nStrengthen engineering quality:\nPromote best practices around performance, maintainability, and resilience across the AI platform, while mentoring and learning alongside the team.\nYour Strengths\nStrong backend engineering experience:\n5+ years building and maintaining scalable backend systems, with a proven history of shipping robust, production-grade software.\nProficiency with TypeScript\n: Most development is done in TypeScript. Experience with Node.js, Temporal, AWS, or PostgreSQL is a plus. Python experience is welcome if you’re comfortable working primarily in TypeScript.\nProduct-oriented mindset:\nYou think beyond correctness and care about how systems enable intuitive, high-quality customer experiences.\nApplied AI integration experience:\nHands-on experience integrating third-party inference services (such as OpenAI or Anthropic) into real product workflows; model training is not required.\nDistributed systems expertise\n: Comfortable designing event-driven, data-intensive architectures that operate reliably at scale.\nPrompt and context design knowledge\n: Familiarity with prompt construction and context management is a strong plus.\nPragmatic execution style:\nYou balance technical depth with speed, adapt quickly, and enjoy iterating in a fast-moving AI environment.\nBenefits & Perks\nCompetitive Salary\nCompetitive Employee Equity\n401K Program\nMedical, Dental, and Vision Benefits\nFSA/HSA Benefit\n$175/month Commuter Benefit\nAdditional Wellbeing Benefits\nFlexible Paid Time Off\nPaid Parental Leave\nProfessional Development Stipend\nHybrid Office Policy\nLunch and dinner daily\nCompany Sponsored Social Events\nAt Sprig, we pride ourselves on being a people-first company, where your contributions truly matter and are valued. We were recently awarded by Fortune as top 50 best places to work in the US, and top 50 Places to Work in the Bay Area by Built In. Come join our mission of building products users love and have a real impact on Sprig’s future.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nWe prioritize diversity within our team and value different perspectives, educational backgrounds, and life experiences. We encourage people from underrepresented backgrounds to apply.\nEmployee Pay Disclosure\nThe salary range for this full-time position is $180,000 - $260,000 + Equity + Benefits. Our cash compensation ranges are determined by role, level, and location. The range displayed on each job posting reflects the minimum and maximum target for new hire salaries for San Francisco, CA.

    "full_description": "Job Application for Director, Industrial Capacity at Anduril Industries\nNew\nDirector, Industrial Capacity\nCosta Mesa, California, United States\nAnduril Industries is a defense technology company with a mission to transform U.S. and allied military capabilities with advanced technology. By bringing the expertise, technology, and business model of the 21st century’s most innovative companies to the defense industry, Anduril is changing how military systems are designed, built and sold. Anduril’s family of systems is powered by Lattice OS, an AI-powered operating system that turns thousands of data streams into a realtime, 3D command and control center. As the world enters an era of strategic competition, Anduril is committed to bringing cutting-edge autonomy, AI, computer vision, sensor fusion, and networking technology to the military in months, not years.\nABOUT THE TEAM\nThis role is part of Anduril’s Corporate Development team and reports to the Head of Corporate Development, with frequent interaction with the c-suite. This role is an excellent fit for someone with an intense personal interest and demonstrated success in driving efficient supply chains and increasing overall industrial capacity. The successful candidate will be both deeply thoughtful about building industrial capacity as well as biased towards taking discrete action that will benefit Anduril’s product portfolio.\nABOUT THE JOB\nAnduril believes very strongly in designing and developing systems that can be produced by the supply chain that America and our allies already have, rather than the supply chain we wish we had. The majority of our products use commercial sector production processes, materials, and components, and Anduril generally prefers to rely on thriving competitive markets with many suppliers instead of vertically integrating our supply chain. As Anduril grows, we will provide additional signal to suppliers about our future needs, allowing them to make good decisions about investing in capacity and designing new products that we will want to use.\nWHAT YOU’LL DO\nYou will develop a repeatable analytical process for assessing Anduril’s long-term industrial capacity needs. You will own this process, but you will also partner with leaders from Anduril’s business development, product, engineering, manufacturing, production and supply chain organizations to identify significant growth areas where Anduril should provide market signal in advance of demand\nYou will collect internal production targets, the design change landscape, and supplier production plans to set up a robust industrial capacity plan capable of scaling with multiple configurations and production rates. You will communicate forecasts to internal stakeholders that accurately reflect Anduril’s business requirements while hedging against potential upside or change in business direction\nIn tandem with a deal leader from the Corporate Development team, you will identify specific areas where Anduril should increase the depth and breadth of available suppliers, and execute strategic partnerships and long-term supplier agreements to create increased capacity\nYou will draft long-form thought leadership, talking points, and other collateral for Anduril’s executive team to use in discussion with elected representatives, customers, the White House, industry partners and in public communications. You will liaise with Anduril’s government and media relations functions to share our perspective on building industrial capacity\nYou will guide and mentor peers and team members across the company to strengthen organizational resiliency and ingrain the concept of increasing industrial capacity in advance of demand\nYou will define and incorporate organization-level processes and improvements that enable the business to scale and efficiently utilize its purchasing power, leveraging learnings from world-class manufacturers and other high-volume industries\nYou will develop easy-to-read reporting and dashboards to measure team KPIs and support the program as it scales\nREQUIRED QUALIFICATIONS\n8+ years of work experience with demonstrated successes in a world-leading engineering, manufacturing, technical procurement or supply chain management organization\nAdvanced proficiency in Excel, financial modeling and data analysis tools, and experience with financial reporting tools and ERP systems (i.e. Anaplan, Netsuite, Oracle, Foundry)\nExceptional written and oral communication skills. You drive consensus through grounded arguments, interpersonal skills, and negotiation skills\nExperience interfacing with leadership and executives - you understand how to cultivate trust and facilitate meetings for and engage with executives\nCombination ability to execute on a tactical level as well as put together a strategy to solve complex, ambiguous, cross-functional problems. You are comfortable rolling up your sleeves and diving deep into executing operational tasks that require high attention to detail and high organization skills, but you can also zoom out and create a strategy that solves high level problems for the business line, division, and company\nHigh ownership with the horsepower to juggle multiple (3-5+) large projects and priorities in parallel, at a rapid pace, and report out on progress regularly without dropping any balls\nComfortable working in a fast-moving, ambiguous environment\nExcited by large breadth of problems\nDiscerning and an incredibly fast learner\nHighly organized\nEligible to obtain and maintain an active U.S. Top Secret security clearance\nMust be a U.S. Person due to required access to U.S. export controlled information or facilities\nUS Salary Range\n$220,000 - $292,000 USD\nThe salary range for this role is an estimate based on a wide range of compensation factors, inclusive of base salary only.

Classification of protected categories\n  is as follows:\nA \"disabled veteran\" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.\nA \"recently separated veteran\" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.\nAn \"active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran\" means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.\nAn \"Armed forces service medal veteran\" means a veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985.\nVeteran Status\nSelect...\nVoluntary Self-Identification of Disability\nForm CC-305\nPage 1 of 1\nOMB Control Number 1250-0005\nExpires 04/30/2026\nWhy are you being asked to complete this form?\nWe are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\nCompleting this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way.

Classification of protected categories\n  is as follows:\nA \"disabled veteran\" is one of the following: a veteran of the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service who is entitled to compensation (or who but for the receipt of military retired pay would be entitled to compensation) under laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; or a person who was discharged or released from active duty because of a service-connected disability.\nA \"recently separated veteran\" means any veteran during the three-year period beginning on the date of such veteran's discharge or release from active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval, or air service.\nAn \"active duty wartime or campaign badge veteran\" means a veteran who served on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service during a war, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized under the laws administered by the Department of Defense.\nAn \"Armed forces service medal veteran\" means a veteran who, while serving on active duty in the U.S. military, ground, naval or air service, participated in a United States military operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was awarded pursuant to Executive Order 12985.\nVeteran Status\nSelect...\nVoluntary Self-Identification of Disability\nForm CC-305\nPage 1 of 1\nOMB Control Number 1250-0005\nExpires 04/30/2026\nWhy are you being asked to complete this form?\nWe are a federal contractor or subcontractor. The law requires us to provide equal employment opportunity to qualified people with disabilities. We have a goal of having at least 7% of our workers as people with disabilities. The law says we must measure our progress towards this goal. To do this, we must ask applicants and employees if they have a disability or have ever had one. People can become disabled, so we need to ask this question at least every five years.\nCompleting this form is voluntary, and we hope that you will choose to do so. Your answer is confidential. No one who makes hiring decisions will see it. Your decision to complete the form and your answer will not harm you in any way. If you want to learn more about the law or this form, visit the U.S. Department of Labor’s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) website at\nwww.dol.gov/ofccp\n.\nHow do you know if you have a disability?\nA disability is a condition that substantially limits one or more of your “major life activities.” If you have or have ever had such a condition, you are a person with a disability.\nDisabilities include, but are not limited to:\nAlcohol or other substance use disorder (not currently using drugs illegally)\nAutoimmune disorder, for example, lupus, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV/AIDS\nBlind or low vision\nCancer (past or present)\nCardiovascular or heart disease\nCeliac disease\nCerebral palsy\nDeaf or serious difficulty hearing\nDiabetes\nDisfigurement, for example, disfigurement caused by burns, wounds, accidents, or congenital disorders\nEpilepsy or other seizure disorder\nGastrointestinal disorders, for example, Crohn's Disease, irritable bowel syndrome\nIntellectual or developmental disability\nMental health conditions, for example, depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorder, schizophrenia, PTSD\nMissing limbs or partially missing limbs\nMobility impairment, benefiting from the use of a wheelchair, scooter, walker, leg brace(s) and/or other supports\nNervous system condition, for example, migraine headaches, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis (MS)\nNeurodivergence, for example, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, dyslexia, dyspraxia, other learning disabilities\nPartial or complete paralysis (any cause)\nPulmonary or respiratory conditions, for example, tuberculosis, asthma, emphysema\nShort stature (dwarfism)\nTraumatic brain injury\nDisability Status\nSelect...\nPUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.

Now, Morpho is scaling its team of contributors to establish itself as a cornerstone, not just of DeFi, but of a new internet-native financial system.\nOur Mission\nMorpho’s mission is to power human ambition with open access to capital. Human ambition has no borders, but the capital to fuel it does. Today’s financial system is closed and fragmented. No one sees all opportunities, most overpay, and some are excluded entirely. We believe capital should flow efficiently to where it’s needed most — giving anyone, anywhere, access to the best possible terms.\nLocation\nParis or remote (from -5h GMT up to +2h GMT to ensure sufficient overlap with the rest of the team).\nHow we work\nWe move fast on hard problems in a nascent market with no set playbook : navigating uncertainty is part of the job.

    "full_description": "Job Application for Software Engineer II, AI Platform at Flexport\nBack to jobs\nNew\nSoftware Engineer II, AI Platform\nAmsterdam, Netherlands\nAbout Flexport:\nAt Flexport, we believe global trade can move the human race forward. That’s why it’s our mission to make global commerce so easy there will be more of it. We’re shaping the future of a $10T industry with solutions powered by innovative technology and exceptional people. Today, companies of all sizes—from emerging brands to Fortune 500s—use Flexport technology to move more than $19B of merchandise across 112 countries a year.\nThe recent global supply chain crisis has put Flexport center stage as we continue to play a pivotal role in how goods move around the world. We are proud to have the support of the best investors in the game who believe in our mission, solutions and people. Ready to tackle global challenges that impact business, society, and the environment? Come join us.\nThe $8.6 trillion freight forwarding industry runs on phone calls, faxes, and emails. At Flexport, we're changing that with software—and now, with AI, we're accelerating the transformation by orders of magnitude.\nOur AI Platform team in Amsterdam is building the intelligence layer that will make every person at Flexport exponentially more effective. We're not just building chatbots—we're creating autonomous agents that eliminate toil, catch errors before they cascade, and handle the \"long tail\" of logistics operations that traditional software could never economically address. This isn't hypothetical—we already have agents saving thousands of hours per week. You'll be building the platform that multiplies that impact across the entire company.\nThis is a rare opportunity to work at the intersection of AI and a massive real-world problem space. You'll build systems that directly impact how $19 billion of goods move across 112 countries, touching everything from customs compliance to document processing to incident response.\nWhat You'll Build:\nAutomation Engineering Platform\nBuild the infrastructure that lets operators create AI-powered workflows without writing code—parsing emails against SOPs, extracting data from documents, creating smart work queues, and deploying ambient quality agents that catch problems before they become incidents\nCreate the tooling that transforms subject matter experts into automation engineers\nCreate AI powered safeguards and security, that monitor usage and warn (or even intervene) when we have potential problems.\nSecure AI Infrastructure\nBuild a production-grade, internal AI chat surface with granular MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration, giving different teams secure access to the right internal tools and data\nCreate an MCP gateway that safely exposes internal services to client-side AI agents, enabling developers to use tools like Claude Code against Flexport's systems\nNavigate the rapidly evolving auth and security landscape of AI tooling—you'll be solving problems that don't have Stack Overflow answers yet\nAgent Templates & Deployment\nTurn our most successful AI agents—security monitoring, data repair, compliance checking, incident response—into reusable templates\nBuild the deployment infrastructure that makes it trivial to spin up new specialized agents for different use cases\nDesign systems that make agents observable, debuggable, and improvable over time\nWhy This Role Is Special:\nYou're early\n: AI in enterprise is still being figured out. The patterns you build here could become industry standards\nReal problems\n: You're not optimizing ad clicks—you're helping businesses move physical goods across borders more efficiently\nAutonomy\n: You'll own entire projects from conception to deployment\nLearning\n: You'll work alongside people who have built successful AI agents in production and know what works (and what doesn't)\nYou Should Have:\n≥ 3\nyears of software engineering experience\n, and having built at least one or two production LLM applications\nFull-stack capability\n: You're comfortable deploying services on Kubernetes/AWS, designing backend systems for LLMs, and building frontend applications when needed\nDeep LLM experience\n: You understand agent patterns, workflows, MCP, RAG, prompt engineering. You've worked with frameworks like LangChain, LlamaIndex, or built your own orchestration layers.\nEntrepreneurial mindset\n: You can take a vague problem (\"make compliance checking automatic\"), design the full solution, and ship it to production without needing your hand held\nA love of simple, well-tested code\nthat is easy to extend and hard to break—especially important when working with non-deterministic AI systems\nExcellent communication skills\n: You'll be working directly with operators, product teams, and leadership to understand needs and explain technical tradeoffs\nA bias for action\n: When you see an opportunity to eliminate toil or catch errors, you build it\nNon-optional\n: an aptitude for learning quickly in a space where best practices are being written in real-time\nNice to Have:\nExperience with security, especially around API gateways and auth systems\nExperience with workflow orchestration tools (Temporal, Airflow, etc.)\nFamiliarity with the logistics or supply chain domain\nCommitment to Equal Opportunity\nAt Flexport, our ability to fulfill our mission of making global commerce easy and accessible relies on having a diverse, dedicated and engaged workforce. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, physical and mental disability, health status, marital and family status, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, military and veteran status, and any other characteristic protected by applicable law.\nGlobal Data Privacy Notice for Job Candidates and Applicants\nDepending on your location, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) may regulate the way we manage the data of job applicants. By submitting your application, you are agreeing to our use and processing of your data as required.

Everyone needs a place to live and access to quality healthcare, yet both are often harder to secure than they should be.\nBy integrating AI agents deeply into existing workflows, we make them more efficient, reduce costs, and improve the experience for everyone.\nHousing\n: We simplify how renters tour apartments, sign leases, submit maintenance requests, and stay connected with their property team—bringing everything they need for their home into one place.\nHealthcare\n: We make it easy to schedule appointments, complete intake forms, and we help patients communicate with providers, so everyone can focus on health instead of paperwork.\nWith EliseAI, organizations reduce manual work, improve accessibility, and deliver a seamless experience across essential services. We recently raised a\n$250 million Series E round\nled by Andreessen Horowitz to accelerate this mission.\nAbout the role\nDesigners are pivotal in creating and orchestrating visual elements into cohesive and impactful compositions. You will develop and refine visual designs, focusing on brand and storytelling, ensuring clarity, coherence, and alignment with brand standards. You’ll drive projects from concept to completion, managing timelines and deliverables autonomously. Engaging in interdisciplinary projects, you’ll contribute to and guide design choices, offering strategic recommendations and solutions.\nAs a Designer, you are expected to demonstrate depth in the craft of visual design. You will be the backbone of your projects, planning, prioritizing, and delivering visual design activities independently. You will lead conversations within your domain, providing recommendations and guiding design choices, while ensuring high-quality outcomes that support both user needs and business goals.\nKey Responsibilities\nTranslate brand principles, themes, and moods into strategic frameworks for visual expressions and creative decision-making\nEvolve the brand system to bring consistency, scalability, and flexibility across all customer touchpoints\nCreate multi-media narratives that tell engaging stories of teams, projects, or deliverables, tailored to audience and communication objectives\nEvolve the website and digital experiences to effectively communicate our value proposition, positioning, and unique brand character\nDrive collaboration with marketing, product, and sales teams to align design work with business goals and execution roadmaps\nDesign a wide range of marketing materials, including digital and print ads, social media graphics, website elements, email templates, presentations, and promotional items, ensuring brand integrity and creative excellence\nDevelop brand guidelines, toolkits, and templates to empower teams and maintain consistent quality across all outputs\nContribute to product design by supporting UI polish, visual consistency, and brand alignment within digital products\nManage multiple design projects simultaneously, prioritizing work to meet deadlines and maintain high standards\nAnalyze brand performance and gather insights to inform and refine visual strategies and creative approaches\nAdvocate for design excellence, brand consistency, and creative innovation across the organization\nMove at rocket speed, build something massive.\nWe’re scaling fast, solving real client problems with precision and ambition. Here, you own your impact; full autonomy, no micromanagement, no fluff. We hire the best, expect the best, and give you the masterclass of your career. It’s hard, it’s intense, and it’s the most rewarding work you’ll ever do. If you’re hungry, driven, and ready to build something massive, climb aboard.\nRequirements\n3+ years of professional brand design experience\nComfortable working in fast paced environment with high volume of deliverables\nStrong portfolio showcasing proficiency in creating visually appealing and thoughtful designs\nConfident presentation and storytelling abilities\nComfort and confidence in collaborating closely with departments such as sales, marketing, and product\nProficiency with contemporary design tools and methods such as Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Photoshop) and Figma\nBonus if you have\nA university degree in Graphic Design, Visual Communications, or a related design or artistic discipline\nExperience working in a variety of organizations (startup, corporate, agency/consultancy)\nExperience collaborating closely with product teams or working on product design initiatives\nExperience with motion design or incorporating motion into storytelling and brand expression\nWhy Join\nGrowth and impact. It’s not often that you can get in on the ground floor of a funded (\nunicorn!\n) startup that’s scaling so fast. That means that instead of following a playbook, you’ll be writing it. Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. You’ll learn what works when you succeed and what doesn’t when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.\nBenefits\nIn addition to the growth and impact you’ll have at EliseAI, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:\nEquity in the company\nMedical, Dental and Vision premiums covered at 100%\nFully paid parental leave\nCommuter benefits\n401k benefits\nMonthly fitness stipend\nA collaborative in-office environment with an open floor plan, fully stocked kitchen, and company-paid lunch.\nFun company social events through our Elise and the City program\nUnlimited vacation and paid holidays\nWe'll cover relocation packages and make the move exciting, not painful!\nJob Compensation Range\nThe salary range for this role is $100,000 - $160,000.

Kalshi allows people to trade on the outcome of any events and turn any question about the future into a financial asset. Kalshi fought for years and legalized prediction markets in the US for the first time in history, is currently the fastest growing financial market in America, and has thousands of markets across politics, economics, financials, weather, tech, AI, culture and more.\nWe believe prediction markets have the potential to be the largest financial market because they turn anything into a financial position.\nOur vision: well… build the largest financial market on the planet.\nOur mission: bring more truth to the world through the power of markets.\nOur culture is simple: we hire really talented people, work really hard, and enjoy the climb. We are looking for ambitious and exceptional people to join our (relatively small) team to help us build the next generation of financial markets.\nRole Roadmap\nWe’re looking for a highly execution-oriented growth marketer to own and scale performance-driven partnerships with DSPs and affiliate platforms. This role sits at the intersection of paid acquisition and business development, with clear accountability for growth, efficiency, and incremental lift.\nYou’ll be the primary operator responsible for launching new DSP relationships, negotiating commercial terms, onboarding supply, testing quickly, and scaling spend while maintaining strict CAC discipline. Success in this role comes from a bias toward action, comfort operating in ambiguity, and the ability to turn partners into repeatable, high-ROI acquisition channels.\nWhat You'll Do\nOwn and scale performance-driven partnerships with DSPs and affiliate platforms, with responsibility for growth, efficiency, and execution\nIdentify, source, and launch new DSP and affiliate relationships, including pitching Kalshi and negotiating commercial terms\nOnboard new supply and partners, ensuring smooth technical and operational setup\nDesign and run rapid testing frameworks across partners, creatives, audiences, and bidding strategies\nScale spend on winning channels while maintaining strict CAC discipline\nWork closely with internal performance, creative, and data teams to build, test, and optimize campaigns\nAnalyze partner performance to surface insights and opportunities for efficiency, volume, and incremental lift\nBuild repeatable playbooks that turn DSPs into durable, scalable acquisition channels\nMaintain clear accountability to volume, efficiency, and overall growth impact\nWhat You Bring\n3–5 years of experience in performance marketing, growth, paid acquisition, or partnership-driven user acquisition\nHands-on experience working with DSPs, affiliate platforms, or performance media partners\nStrong analytical instincts and comfort operating against CAC and ROI targets\nExperience launching new channels or partnerships from zero to scale\nAbility to own work end-to-end, from negotiation and testing through optimization and scaling\nStrong cross-functional collaboration skills, especially with performance, creative, and data teams\nA scrappy, execution-first mindset with a bias toward speed, experimentation, and measurable impact\nNYC Pay Transparency Disclosure\nBase Salary Range:\n$110,000–$155,000\nThis range reflects current market data for this role. Kalshi has minimal hierarchy and broad variance in experience levels within each title; if your compensation expectations exceed this range, we encourage you to reach out — we’re always happy to discuss.\nOur Culture\nMeritocracy is at our core, and we value people who take ownership and figure (usually hard) things out. We dream big. We love our craft deeply and are proud of what we put out in the world. We are committed to our vision of building something big… but also useful: a product that brings more truth through the power of markets.\nKalshians are Kalshi’s most important asset: we pick Kalshians carefully, so we trust them fully on day 1.\nCommitment to Equal Opportunity\nKalshi is committed to creating a culture of inclusion and belonging, and we are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We believe it is our collective responsibility to uphold these values and encourage candidates from all backgrounds to join us in our mission. All qualified applicants will be treated with respect and receive equal consideration for employment without regard to race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, disability, uniform service, veteran status, age, or any other protected characteristic per federal, state, or local law.

These are the decisions that shape real-world outcomes: whether rockets successfully launch into space, autonomous vehicles make it to market, or communities recover after major storms.\nUntil now, insurance has been making billion-dollar decisions using outdated tools. We’re changing that. Our platform brings together data, AI, and human expertise to give insurers the fastest path from submission to decision - helping them move faster, act smarter, and take on more risk with confidence.\nBacked by a16z, Highland Europe, and Battery Ventures, we’re scaling globally - already trusted by nearly 50 of the world’s largest insurers, with zero churn and billions in premiums flowing through hx.\nWhat began as a single product in one market has rapidly evolved into a multi-product, multi-territory platform powering every stage of pricing and underwriting. AI is at the core of what we do - from building the world’s first domain-specific AI peer programmer for insurance (think GitHub Copilot with a PhD in actuarial science) to shaping agentic workflows that reinvent how this industry operates.\nWhat makes hx different is the people who build it. Here, impact isn’t tied to title or tenure; it’s defined by the challenges you take on and the discipline you bring. Surrounded by peers who stretch you, you’ll do the best, hardest work of your life in a company engineered to endure.\nIf that sounds like you, join us in building what comes next.\nAbout the hxAI team\nAt hx, AI is central to how we build software and make decisions across the company. From large-scale document intelligence to a domain-specific AI peer-programmer used by actuaries and underwriters, hx is redefining how the insurance industry uses generative AI in production.\nThe AI Platform team provides the platform that makes all of this possible. We design, build, and operate the shared systems that allow teams to train, deploy, evaluate, and monitor AI safely at scale — including model serving, data pipelines, observability, deployment automation, and compute orchestration.\nWorking closely with product and research teams, we turn fast-moving experimentation into reliable, cost-efficient, and developer-friendly production systems. Our success is measured in faster releases, stronger model performance in the real world, and AI products that customers can trust with critical decisions.\nWhat you’ll be doing\nDesigning and operating scalable AI infrastructure for LLM inference, prompt management, and evaluation pipelines, supporting billions in premium flow.\nBuilding self-service tools, SDKs, and APIs that empower product teams to move from prototype to production 30% faster.\nInstrumenting production AI/ML workloads with standardised logging, tracing, and evaluation metrics, increasing observability coverage to 100% of deployed models.\nImplementing intelligent routing, caching, and provider optimisation via the LLM gateway, reducing AI compute costs by up to 25%.\nDriving adoption of shared platform services (LLM gateway, evaluation frameworks, monitoring) to replace bespoke solutions, increasing platform adoption across new AI features.\nChampioning developer experience by delivering comprehensive documentation and responsive support, resulting in higher internal customer satisfaction.\nWhat you’ll need to have done\nBuilt and deployed production AI infrastructure that scaled to support enterprise-grade reliability and observability.\nDelivered self-service tools or APIs that enabled multiple product teams to accelerate their AI/ML development cycles.\nImplemented evaluation frameworks, A/B testing infrastructure, or monitoring solutions that measured and improved model performance, latency, cost, and quality in production.\nLed initiatives to reduce AI compute costs through optimisation strategies such as intelligent routing or caching.\nSuccessfully migrated teams from bespoke AI solutions to shared platform services, driving measurable adoption.\nPrioritised and improved developer experience through documentation, support, or workflow enhancements.\nYou’re unlikely to thrive here if\nYou prefer working in silos rather than collaborating closely with product and engineering teams.\nYou are uncomfortable with rapid change or ambiguity in technical requirements.\nYou are not motivated to take ownership and drive measurable impact beyond your immediate tasks.\nIf reading our\nCulture Document\nleaves you feeling neutral rather than energised, hx may not be the place where you'll do your best work. We're building something that asks for commitment and conviction, and we want you to feel excited by the opportunity to grow with us.\nCompensation\nAt hx, we're committed to salary transparency. You'll always have clarity on pay early in the process - our Talent Partner will share details with you during initial conversations - and we're working towards publishing salary information for all roles globally.\nBecause we're building at the intersection of technology/SaaS and insurance, our roles don't always map neatly onto traditional benchmarks. Our approach is to design compensation that's competitive in the market, fair across teams, and aligned with the impact our people make.\nEquity: We offer equity across all roles at hx, making it a significant component of total compensation. Your Talent Partner will be able to share more details about this.\nBenefits\n£5,000 training and conference budget for individual and group development.\n25 days of holiday plus 8 bank holidays (33 days total).\nCompany pension scheme via Penfold.\nMental health support and therapy via\nSpectrum.life\n.\nIndividual wellbeing allowance via Juno.\nPrivate healthcare insurance through AXA.\nIncome protection and Life Insurance.\nCycle to Work Scheme.\nAdditional perks\nTop-spec equipment (laptop, screens, adjustable desks, etc.).\nRegular remote and in-person hackathons, lunch and learns, socials, and game nights.\nTeam breakfasts and lunches, snacks, drinks fridge, and a fun office at\nThe Ministry\n.\nExceptional opportunities for personal development and growth as we build something remarkable together.\nInterview process\nInitial chat with our Talent team (30 minutes).\nManager Interview (60 minutes).\nTechnical Assessment (e.g., code review, system design) (120 minutes).\nValues Interview with Senior Tech Leadership (60 minutes).\nWe offer!\nOur commitment to Diversity\nhxers are at the centre of everything we build. We know that progress depends on diverse perspectives, and we are committed to creating an environment where everyone can thrive, grow, and make an impact. We recognise there is always more to do, and we take responsibility for shaping a workplace that is not only diverse but genuinely inclusive.\nDiversity is not just the right thing to do, it is key to solving the complex challenges we choose to take on. By welcoming people from all backgrounds and experiences, we strengthen our ability to question assumptions, push boundaries, and design solutions that endure.\nIf you're energised by complexity and motivated to grow, we encourage you to apply and join our global team.\nNext steps\nIf this opportunity resonates with you, we encourage you to apply or share it with your connections! Our dedicated talent team reviews all applications, and we promise to provide feedback regardless of the outcome.\nFor more information about applying and to view other opportunities, you can visit our careers page.\nPlease note that background checks will be conducted as part of the hiring process to ensure compliance with our governance policies.

Everyone needs a place to live and access to quality healthcare, yet both are often harder to secure than they should be.\nBy integrating AI agents deeply into existing workflows, we make them more efficient, reduce costs, and improve the experience for everyone.\nHousing\n: We simplify how renters tour apartments, sign leases, submit maintenance requests, and stay connected with their property team—bringing everything they need for their home into one place.\nHealthcare\n: We make it easy to schedule appointments, complete intake forms, and we help patients communicate with providers, so everyone can focus on health instead of paperwork.\nWith EliseAI, organizations reduce manual work, improve accessibility, and deliver a seamless experience across essential services. We recently raised a\n$250 million Series E round\nled by Andreessen Horowitz to accelerate this mission.\nAbout the Role\nAs Director of Lifecycle & Account-Based Marketing, you’ll own EliseAI’s most critical revenue-driving programs, combining precision Account-Based Marketing (ABM) with full-funnel lifecycle marketing to accelerate pipeline, increase win rates, and drive long-term customer growth.\nYou’ll lead a high-performing team while remaining hands-on, building and executing highly targeted, multi-channel programs for our highest-value accounts and scalable lifecycle journeys that convert prospects into customers and customers into long-term partners.

Here, you own your impact; full autonomy, no micromanagement, no fluff.\nWe hire the best, expect the best, and give you the masterclass of your career. It’s hard, it’s intense, and it’s the most rewarding work you’ll ever do.

Every single day you will be challenged to identify how we can scale and execute on it. You’ll learn what works when you succeed and what doesn’t when you fail. Either way, the rest of the team will be here to support you.\nBenefits\nIn addition to the growth and impact you’ll have at EliseAI, we offer competitive salaries along with the following benefits:\nEquity in the company\nMedical, Dental and Vision premiums covered at 100%\nFully paid parental leave\nCommuter benefits\n401k benefits\nFitness & home services stipend to cover part of your expenses so you can focus on what matters\nA collaborative in-office environment with an open floor plan, fully stocked kitchen, and all meals covered in the office\nUnlimited vacation and paid holidays\nWe'll cover relocation packages and make the move exciting, not painful!\nJob Compensation Range\nThe salary range for this role is\n$200,000 - $250,000.\nEliseAI offers a competitive total rewards package which includes base salary, equity, and a comprehensive benefits & perks package.

Right now it needs to protect the 17 million+ verified World ID users processing millions of identity and financial transactions a day, and it will need to rapidly scale to protect billions of users using trusted and untrusted hardware, much of which we will not own. We will publish audit events to the public blockchain for the highest possible transparency and trust of the World ID system, and build decentralized detection & response using those logs. We need to do all this while maintaining the strongest possible privacy protections.\nAbout You\nStudying / researching / working with verifiable compute (e.g. zero knowledge ML or zero knowledge virtual machines)\nSome exposure to Rust programming.\nStrong critical thinking and communication skills\nComfort working cross-functionally with different teams.\nEnergized by working in a fast-paced, collaborative environment\nIf you don't think you meet all of the criteria but still are interested in the job, please apply. Nobody checks every box, and we're looking for someone excited to join the team.\nNice-to-Have Skills\nPrior hands-on use of\nRiscZero\n,\nSuccinct\n,\nBoundless\n, or other zkVM frameworks.\nBy submitting your application, you consent to the processing and internal sharing of your CV within the company, in compliance with the GDPR.\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google\nPrivacy Policy\nand\nTerms of Service\napply.\nPowered by\nAshby\nPrivacy Policy\nSecurity\nVulnerability Disclosure"
